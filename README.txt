Insta Chatbot
Written by Dylan Webb 
Version 1 -- 5/22/2020

InstaChatbot.exe and main.cpp included
Download InstaChatbot.exe or compile main.cpp and place it in a folder
Request your data from instagram and locate the messages.json file in the folder you are sent
Place the messages.json file in the same folder as the InstaChatbot.exe program

Run the program, and enter your instagram username
This will not in any way affect your account--it will simply separate your messages from those replying to you
First time setup takes a little longer to get started
The program will create a convo.txt file which it will reference in the future

Now enter anything you would like to say, and the chatbot will respond
It searches for a similar message in your conversations and generates a response like the one given there
Enjoy!
